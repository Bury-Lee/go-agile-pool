// Plugin interfaces follow a "minimal core + optional capabilities" design
// instead of one big interface: a simple plugin only needs Name/Desc/Run.
// Help output, lifecycle management and dependency declarations are separate
// optional interfaces the host detects by type assertion (see execSession),
// so a plugin file makes its own role obvious and the host never needs to
// know concrete plugin types.

// Runtime is the only environment handle given to plugins. Out/Err are the
// global streams and Store carries session-level shared data. Everything is
// passed in (never package globals) so sessions stay isolated and testable.

// Plugin is the minimum contract. Name must be unique: the CLI uses it as
// the segment header ("--<name>") and the registry keys on it; a duplicate
// is rejected by NewRegistry.

// Lifecycle is the session-scoped lifecycle. Start runs before every Run,
// in plan order, and End runs after every Run, in reverse order.
//
// Start takes args because envelope plugins (metrics, profile) must be in
// place before the session begins (sampler goroutine up, pprof started),
// and args only arrive with the segment. End takes no args: teardown never
// needs them since Start/Run already parsed what it requires.

// metadata consumed by the planner (auto-insertion, ordering checks, cycle
// detection); the Run code itself only reads dependency outputs from Store.
