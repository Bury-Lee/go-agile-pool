// init() self-registration: init ordering is compiler-determined and
// invisible, while one list makes the whole plugin set obvious. Adding a
// plugin means adding one line here.
//
// metrics/profile keep state across phases (Start parses and stores, End
// reads), so pointer instances are registered.
